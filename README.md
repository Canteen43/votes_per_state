Hi! This is a small project where I want to find out what is the relative vote power of inhabitants of each US state.

To calculate this, I will look online for tables on the electoral seats per state and the inhabitants per state.
Electoral Votes:
https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation
Inhabitants:
https://www.britannica.com/topic/largest-U-S-state-by-population
I added both to WaybackMachine on March 28, 2024.

In my python script, you can see how I did it.
