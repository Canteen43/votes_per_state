Hi! This is a small project where I want to find out what is the relative vote power of inhabitants of each US state.

To calculate this, I will look online for tables on the electoral seats per state and the inhabitants per state.
Electoral Votes:
https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation
Inhabitants:
https://www.britannica.com/topic/largest-U-S-state-by-population
I added both to WaybackMachine.

Now I need a python script that can read these in.
My first try did not work because the server blocked the python request, so I downloaded python requests to mimic a browser request.
Now I can import the first table into a data frame... importing worked but the data has to be transformed in a more readable and logic form.

The details of how I did it are described in the python script.
